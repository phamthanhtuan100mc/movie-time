# Movie Time

This app is written when I have to work onsite in Japan. The internet condition is very bad. My company only rent me a room with wifi pocket which have very limited data access, not able to connect to wifi. Making a video call with my girl friend is very hard. If we want to watch film together, she have to share the screen and play video but I still not able to cacth up video content.
I have an idea to write an app that load available video in each other laptop (Thanks god I can download film using company wifi), then play it at the same time. So we can enjoy film together and save my internet data.

Maybe this app still not done when I come back to Viet Nam which have strong wifi connection. But I still want to complete this project.
This app was written in MacOS, still not tested in Windows.
