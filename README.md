# Movie Time

## Movitation

This app is written when I have to work onsite in Japan. The internet condition is very bad. My company only rent me a room with a pocket Wi-Fi which have very limited data access, not able to connect to Wi-Fi. Making a video call with my girl friend is very hard. If we want to watch film together, she have to share the screen and play video but I still not able to cacth up video content.
I have an idea to write an app that load available video in each other laptop (Thanks god I can download film using company Wi-Fi), then play it at the same time. So we can enjoy film together and save my internet data.

Maybe this app still not done when I come back to Viet Nam which have strong Wi-Fi connection. But I still want to complete this project.
This app was written in MacOS, still not tested in Windows.
